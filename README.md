This project is part of a challenge. I was to fix and debug a broken page. I found the solutions after a couple of days of playing with the code. This project took me a lot less time than the tea cozy project.
This was a lot of fun.

I found that the solution code varies from mine, but it is very simple and it reminds me of something that an acquaintance of mine mentioned. The best code is usually the simple. It is not overly complicated. It is something I frequently think about whenever I work on my code. It try to keep it simple. It doesn't mean boring. A page can be elaborate and have a lot of CSS styles, but that does not make it complicated.
Whenever I think my page might be getting complicated, I ask myself "Am I doing something wrong?" Sometimes it is the case.

Once I figured out what ID's belonged to which items, the page became easier to debug.
I am not sure I caught all the bugs but I am very happy with the progress I have made so far.
The page is responsive and includes media tags for a variety of sizes.

There is a before of this page that is available on codeacademy to view. I might link it to my original post.

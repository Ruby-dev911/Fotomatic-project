This project is part of a challenge. I was to fix and debug a broken page. I found the solution after a couple of days of playing with the code.
Once I figured out what ID's belonged to which items, the page became easier to debug.
I am not sure I caught all the bugs but I am very happy with the progress I have made so far.
The page is responsive and includes media tags for a variety of sizes.
